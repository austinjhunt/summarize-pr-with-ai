The code changes include the creation of a new `.env-sample` file with an OpenAI API key placeholder. The `.gitignore` file was updated to ignore the `.env` file and a `venv` directory. A new `README.md` file was created, providing instructions on how to setup and use a new utility for summarizing changes on a PR/branch. Finally, a new `requirements.txt` file was added, outlining the necessary Python dependencies for the project.
